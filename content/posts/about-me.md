# About Me

**Hi, I'm Tina!**

I was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina and spent nearly a decade in New York City building my career in tech before trading coasts and moving to San Francisco in 2021. 

Life took a few unexpected (but wonderful) turns in California. I bought my first bike - and promptly replaced it with a second, better fitting bike - and it didn't take long for me to realize that traveling by bike is a far more efficient and exhilarating way to travel than by my own two feet. (I was also marathon training in SF, which hastened the speed of this discovery.) 

This is a place for me to document my journey, along with my musings, lessons, and (many) mishaps along the way.
